# NET-Demo

This is a demo of a .NET project

The zipped files should be extracted as is and placed into a new folder called "RJEApp1"
The "packages1" and "packages2" folder contents should be merged into one "packages" folder. The "packages" folder was split up to accommodate the file size restrictions.

The RJEApp1 folder should have the following structure:

/RJEApp1

/RJEApp1/.vs

/RJEApp1/packages

/RJEApp1/RJEApp1

/RJEApp1/RJEApp1.sln

The project should then be able to be accessed through Visual Studio
